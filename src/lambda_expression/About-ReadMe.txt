            What is it?
    - Implements functional interfaces
    - A topic that I find difficult
    - An excuse for not studying MAFI 1
    - Arrow operator thing

            Why Lamda?

   Supposedly
    - Simplificates code - makes it shorter/less lines

    - Sequential and Parallel execution support
     by passing behavior as an argument
     in methods

    - Higher Efficiency âˆ’ By using Stream API
    and lambda expressions, we can achieve
    higher efficiency (parallel execution)
    in case of bulk operations on collections. Also, lambda expression
    helps in achieving the internal
    iteration of collections rather than
    external iteration. (???)

    What I (barely) understood:

    - works with/for/to functional interfaces
